/**
 * Stores application-scoped information relevant to JSP containers.
 *
 * <p>
 * The JSP container must create a single instance of <code>JspApplicationContext</code> for each
 * <code>ServletContext</code> instance.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An instance of <code>JspApplicationContext</code> is obtained by invoking the static
 * {@link JspFactory#getJspApplicationContext} method, passing the <code>ServletContext</code> of the corresponding web
 * application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>JspApplicationContext</code> provides the following services to JSP applications:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Allows registration of <code>ELResolver</code>s, which are used to resolve variables in EL expressions contained
 * in JSP pages and tag files.</li>
 * <li>Provides an instance of <code>ExpressionFactory</code> for those applications or frameworks that need to perform
 * programmatic evaluation of EL expressions instead of allowing the JSP container to do it for them.</li>
 * <li>Allows the attachment of <code>ELContextListener</code> instances for notification whenever a new
 * <code>ELContext</code> is created. This is necessary when an application wishes to make custom context objects
 * available to their pluggable <code>ELResolver</code>s.</li>
 * </ul>

     * appearing in JSP pages and tag files.
     *
     * <p>
     * For example, in the EL expression ${employee.lastName}, an <code>ELResolver</code> determines what object
     * "employee" references and how to find its "lastName" property.

     *
     * <p>

     * <code>IllegalStateException</code> is thrown.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This restriction is in place to allow the JSP container to optimize for the common case where no additional
     * <code>ELResolver</code>s are in the chain, aside from the standard ones. It is permissible to add
     * <code>ELResolver</code>s before or after initialization to a <code>CompositeELResolver</code> that is already in
     * the chain.
